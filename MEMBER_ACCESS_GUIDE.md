# Member Access by Email and Phone - Implementation Guide

## Overview

This feature allows members to log in and view all stokvels they are linked to by matching their login credentials (email and phone number) with member records in the database.

## How It Works

### Multi-Field Matching Strategy

When a user logs in, the system checks for stokvel memberships using three matching criteria:

1. **Member ID (UUID)** - Direct user account link
2. **Email Address** - Matches user's login email with member email
3. **Phone Number** - Matches user's phone from profile metadata with contact number

### User Flow

1. **Member Addition by Admin**
   - Admin adds a member to their stokvel with email: `john@example.com` and phone: `+27123456789`
   - The member record is created with `member_id` initially set to a placeholder or the admin's user ID

2. **Member Login**
   - Member registers/logs in with email: `john@example.com`
   - System automatically detects their membership by matching email
   - Member can now see all stokvels where they are registered

3. **Viewing Stokvels**
   - Navigate to `/members` route (or click "My Memberships" in navigation)
   - All stokvels where the user is a member are displayed
   - Each card shows role, rotation order, join date, and stokvel details

## Technical Implementation

### Database Structure

**Table: `user_stokvel_members`**
```sql
- id: UUID (primary key)
- stokvel_id: UUID (references user_stokvels)
- member_id: UUID (references auth.users)
- email: TEXT (NOT NULL)
- contact_number: TEXT (optional)
- role: 'admin' | 'member'
- rotation_order: INTEGER
- is_active: BOOLEAN
```

### Updated Hook: `useUserStokvelMemberships`

**Location:** `src/hooks/useUserStokvels.ts`

**Key Features:**
- Fetches memberships matching by `member_id`, `email`, or `contact_number`
- Uses Supabase `.or()` query for multi-field matching
- Returns `StokvelWithType[]` with membership metadata

**Query Logic:**
```typescript
.or(`member_id.eq.${userId},email.eq.${userEmail},contact_number.eq.${userPhone}`)
```

### Row Level Security (RLS) Policies

**File:** `fix-member-access-by-email-phone.sql`

**Updated Policies:**

1. **user_stokvels SELECT Policy**
   - Allows owners to see their stokvels
   - Allows members to see stokvels where they match by ID, email, or phone

2. **user_stokvel_members SELECT Policy**
   - Owners can see all members of their stokvels
   - Members can see other members of stokvels they belong to

3. **stokvel_contributions SELECT Policy**
   - Members can view contributions in stokvels they belong to

4. **stokvel_payouts SELECT Policy**
   - Members can view payouts in stokvels they belong to

**Key RLS Pattern:**
```sql
EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM public.user_stokvel_members usm
    WHERE usm.stokvel_id = stokvel_id
    AND usm.is_active = true
    AND (
        usm.member_id = auth.uid()
        OR usm.email = auth.email()
        OR usm.contact_number = (auth.jwt()->'user_metadata'->>'phone')
    )
)
```

### Performance Optimizations

**Indexes Created:**
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_stokvel_members_email ON user_stokvel_members(email) WHERE is_active = true;
CREATE INDEX idx_stokvel_members_contact ON user_stokvel_members(contact_number) WHERE is_active = true;
CREATE INDEX idx_stokvel_members_member_id ON user_stokvel_members(member_id) WHERE is_active = true;
```

### UI Components

**Members Page Component:** `src/pages/Members.tsx`

**Two Display Modes:**

1. **UserStokvelMemberships** (route: `/members`)
   - Shows all stokvels the user is a member of
   - Filter by role: All, Admin, Member
   - Displays membership cards with:
     - Stokvel name and type icon
     - Role badge (admin gets crown icon)
     - Join date and rotation order
     - Balance and member count
     - Progress to target (if applicable)
     - Action buttons (View Dashboard, Settings)

2. **StokvelMembersManagement** (route: `/stokvel/:stokvelId/members`)
   - Context-specific member management
   - Add/edit/delete members
   - Lottery draw functionality

**Key UI Features:**
- Crown icon (üëë) for admin roles
- Position number badge for rotation order
- Summary cards showing total memberships, active stokvels, total members
- Filter tabs for role-based filtering
- Navigation between owned stokvels and memberships

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Run Database Migration

Execute the SQL migration in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```bash
# File: fix-member-access-by-email-phone.sql
```

This will:
- Update RLS policies for email/phone matching
- Create performance indexes
- Add helper function `check_member_access()`

### 2. Code is Already Updated

The following files have been updated:
- ‚úÖ `src/hooks/useUserStokvels.ts` - Enhanced `useUserStokvelMemberships` hook
- ‚úÖ `src/pages/Members.tsx` - Already uses the hook correctly
- ‚úÖ `src/App.tsx` - Route `/members` already exists

### 3. User Profile Setup (Optional)

For phone number matching to work, ensure users have phone in their metadata:

**During Signup:**
```typescript
const { error } = await supabase.auth.signUp({
  email: 'user@example.com',
  password: 'password',
  options: {
    data: {
      phone: '+27123456789',
      full_name: 'John Doe'
    }
  }
})
```

**Update Profile:**
```typescript
const { error } = await supabase.auth.updateUser({
  data: { phone: '+27123456789' }
})
```

## Testing Guide

### Test Scenario 1: Email Matching

1. **Setup:**
   - Admin creates stokvel "Test Stokvel"
   - Admin adds member with email: `testuser@example.com`, phone: `+27111111111`

2. **Test:**
   - Register new account with email: `testuser@example.com`
   - Log in with that account
   - Navigate to `/members`

3. **Expected Result:**
   - "Test Stokvel" appears in memberships list
   - Shows correct role, rotation order, and join date

### Test Scenario 2: Phone Matching

1. **Setup:**
   - Admin creates stokvel "Phone Test"
   - Admin adds member with email: `any@email.com`, phone: `+27222222222`

2. **Test:**
   - Register new account with different email: `newuser@example.com`
   - Update user profile with phone: `+27222222222`
   - Navigate to `/members`

3. **Expected Result:**
   - "Phone Test" appears in memberships list

### Test Scenario 3: Member ID Matching (Legacy)

1. **Setup:**
   - Admin creates stokvel
   - System automatically adds admin as first member with their UUID

2. **Test:**
   - Log in as admin
   - Navigate to `/members`

3. **Expected Result:**
   - Own stokvel appears with "admin" role and crown icon

### Test Scenario 4: Multiple Memberships

1. **Setup:**
   - User is added to 3 different stokvels with same email
   - User is admin of 1 stokvel
   - User is member of 2 stokvels

2. **Test:**
   - Log in
   - Navigate to `/members`
   - Use filter tabs: All, Admin Roles, Member Roles

3. **Expected Result:**
   - All Memberships: Shows 3 stokvels
   - Admin Roles: Shows 1 stokvel with crown
   - Member Roles: Shows 2 stokvels

## Debugging

### Check Member Records
```sql
SELECT
    usm.id,
    usm.stokvel_id,
    usm.member_id,
    usm.email,
    usm.contact_number,
    usm.role,
    usm.is_active,
    us.name as stokvel_name
FROM user_stokvel_members usm
JOIN user_stokvels us ON us.id = usm.stokvel_id
WHERE usm.email = 'user@example.com'
AND usm.is_active = true;
```

### Check RLS Policies
```sql
SELECT schemaname, tablename, policyname, permissive, roles, cmd
FROM pg_policies
WHERE tablename IN ('user_stokvels', 'user_stokvel_members')
ORDER BY tablename, policyname;
```

### Test Member Access Function
```sql
SELECT public.check_member_access(
    '123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000'::UUID, -- stokvel_id
    auth.uid(), -- user_id
    auth.email(), -- email
    (auth.jwt()->'user_metadata'->>'phone') -- phone
);
```

### Browser Console Logs

The `useUserStokvelMemberships` hook includes detailed console logging:
- üîç User details (ID, email, phone)
- üìä Membership records fetched
- üîç Stokvel IDs being queried
- üìä Stokvel data retrieved
- ‚úÖ Final transformed memberships

## Security Considerations

### RLS Policy Safety
- Policies only allow viewing, not modification
- Active members only (`is_active = true`)
- Separate policies for INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE operations
- Owner-only write access maintained

### Data Privacy
- Members can only see data for stokvels they belong to
- No cross-stokvel data leakage
- Phone numbers stored securely in member records
- Email verification recommended (future enhancement)

### Performance
- Indexed lookups on email, phone, and member_id
- Efficient OR queries in Postgres
- Minimal database round trips (2 queries max)
- React Query caching prevents redundant fetches

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Email Verification
- Verify email ownership before showing membership
- Send verification email to new members
- Mark membership as "pending" until verified

### 2. Phone Verification
- SMS verification for phone-based matching
- Prevent unauthorized phone number claims

### 3. Member Invitations
- Send invitation emails/SMS to new members
- Click-to-join workflow with account creation
- Track invitation status

### 4. Member Profile Linking
- Allow users to link/unlink memberships
- Claim membership with verification code
- Merge duplicate member records

### 5. Multi-Account Support
- Support multiple emails per user
- Support multiple phone numbers
- Consolidated view across accounts

## API Reference

### Hook: `useUserStokvelMemberships()`

**Returns:** `UseQueryResult<StokvelWithType[]>`

**StokvelWithType Properties:**
```typescript
{
  // Base stokvel data
  id: string
  owner_id: string
  name: string
  description: string | null
  monthly_contribution: number
  target_amount: number | null
  currency: string
  start_date: string
  is_active: boolean

  // Joined stokvel type data
  stokvel_type: {
    id: string
    name: string
    description: string
    icon: string | null
    rules_template: StokvelRulesTemplate
  }

  // Membership-specific data
  membership_role?: 'admin' | 'member'
  membership_rotation_order?: number
  membership_join_date?: string
}
```

**Usage Example:**
```typescript
import { useUserStokvelMemberships } from '@/hooks/useUserStokvels'

function MyComponent() {
  const { data: memberships, isLoading } = useUserStokvelMemberships()

  if (isLoading) return <div>Loading...</div>

  return (
    <div>
      {memberships?.map(stokvel => (
        <div key={stokvel.id}>
          <h3>{stokvel.name}</h3>
          <p>Role: {stokvel.membership_role}</p>
          <p>Position: #{stokvel.membership_rotation_order}</p>
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Member not seeing their stokvel

**Possible Causes:**
1. Email mismatch (check case sensitivity)
2. Phone number format mismatch
3. Member record marked as inactive
4. RLS policies not applied correctly

**Solutions:**
1. Check member record in database
2. Verify user's email matches exactly
3. Ensure `is_active = true` on member record
4. Re-run RLS policy migration

### Issue: Performance degradation

**Possible Causes:**
1. Missing indexes
2. Too many stokvels/members
3. Complex RLS policy evaluation

**Solutions:**
1. Verify indexes exist: `idx_stokvel_members_email`, `idx_stokvel_members_contact`
2. Add pagination for large datasets
3. Cache query results with React Query

### Issue: Multiple memberships for same user

**Possible Causes:**
1. Member added multiple times with different identifiers
2. Email/phone updated but old records remain

**Solutions:**
1. Implement deduplication logic
2. Add unique constraint on `(stokvel_id, email)` combination
3. Merge duplicate member records

## Conclusion

This implementation provides a flexible, secure way for members to access their stokvels using email and phone number matching. The system maintains backward compatibility with UUID-based member linking while adding convenience for users who haven't yet registered accounts.

Key benefits:
- ‚úÖ Seamless onboarding for invited members
- ‚úÖ No manual account linking required
- ‚úÖ Secure RLS-based access control
- ‚úÖ Performant with proper indexing
- ‚úÖ Future-proof with extensibility options
