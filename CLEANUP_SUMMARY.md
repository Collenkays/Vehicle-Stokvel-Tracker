## 🗂️ Archive Directory Structure

```
.sql-archive/
├── ARCHIVED_FILES.txt          (documentation)
├── [41 SQL files]              (old debugging files)
└── [4 JS files]                (verification scripts)
```

**Note**: Archive directory is in `.gitignore` and won't be committed to version control.

---

## Why These Files Were Archived

### RLS Policy Files
During development, multiple iterations were needed to fix Row Level Security policies. Each file represented an attempt or debugging step. The final, correct policies are now in `database-schema-multi-stokvel.sql`.

### Verification Scripts
These JavaScript files were created during the schema fix process to verify database structure. They served their purpose and are no longer needed for day-to-day development.

### Old Schema Files
`database-schema.sql` was the original single-stokvel schema, replaced by the multi-stokvel architecture in `database-schema-multi-stokvel.sql`.

---

## What You Should Know

### Safe to Delete
After confirming your application works correctly, you can safely delete the entire `.sql-archive/` directory:

```bash
rm -rf .sql-archive
```

### Not in Git
The `.sql-archive/` directory is excluded from version control via `.gitignore`, so it won't clutter your repository.

### If You Need Them
If you ever need to reference an archived file, they're still available in the archive directory. However, the information they contain has been consolidated into the main schema file.

---

## Developer Guidelines Going Forward

### For Fresh Database Setup
1. Use `database-schema-multi-stokvel.sql` only
2. Run `add-fairness-fields-migration.sql` (if needed)
3. Run `setup-storage-bucket.sql`
4. Run `create-storage-policies.sql`
5. Verify with `verify-constraints.sql`

### For Schema Changes
1. Update `database-schema-multi-stokvel.sql` (single source of truth)
2. Create new migration file if altering existing database
3. Test migration before applying to production
4. Update TypeScript types after schema changes

### Avoid Creating
- Multiple versions of fix files (fix-x-v1, fix-x-v2, etc.)
- Debug/diagnostic files in root (use temporary scripts or .sql-archive)
- Duplicate schema definitions

---

## Results

✅ **Clean root directory** - Only 7 essential SQL files
✅ **Clear documentation** - Each file has a clear purpose
✅ **Archive preserved** - History available if needed
✅ **Git ignored** - Archive won't clutter version control
✅ **Better organization** - Easy to find what you need

## Before & After

### Before
```
./
├── [46 SQL files - mix of schema, fixes, debug]
├── [4 verification JS files]
└── [hard to find what you need]
```

### After
```
./
├── database-schema-multi-stokvel.sql       ← Main schema
├── add-fairness-fields-migration.sql       ← Applied migration
├── database-settings-migration.sql         ← Config
├── verify-constraints.sql                  ← Verification
├── check-schema.sql                        ← Validation
├── setup-storage-bucket.sql                ← Storage setup
├── create-storage-policies.sql             ← Storage security
└── .sql-archive/                           ← 45 archived files (git ignored)
```

**Result**: Clean, organized, easy to understand! 🎉
