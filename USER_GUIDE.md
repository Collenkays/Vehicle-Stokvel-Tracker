1. Introduction

Welcome to Vikoba, your digital companion for managing stokvels easily and transparently.

Vikoba is a web-based tool designed to help South African communities organize, track, and grow their group savings. Whether your stokvel is for vehicle purchases, groceries, burial societies, or investments, Vikoba gives you the tools to record contributions, manage members, process payouts, and ensure fairness across all participants.

What is a Stokvel?

A stokvel is a community savings group where members pool money together for a shared goal. Members contribute regularly (usually monthly), and funds are distributed according to agreed-upon rules.

Stokvels thrive on trust, community, and mutual support — and Vikoba helps you digitize these values with accuracy and transparency.
