# Settings Feature Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ Phase 1 & 2 Complete

Successfully implemented comprehensive settings system for Vehicle Stokvel Tracker covering both stokvel-specific and global user settings.

---

## üì¶ What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Schema (Migration Required)
**File**: `database-settings-migration.sql`

Created comprehensive database schema for settings:
- **user_preferences** table for global account settings
- Extended **user_stokvels** table with:
  - `notification_settings` (JSONB) for stokvel notifications
  - `late_payment_penalty_rate` for contribution rules
  - `grace_period_days` for payment deadlines
  - `joining_fee` for new member fees
  - `require_payment_verification` for payment validation
  - `allow_emergency_withdrawals` for emergency access
  - `emergency_withdrawal_limit` for withdrawal caps
  - `minimum_rollover_balance` for balance management
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies for data protection
- Automatic triggers for `updated_at` timestamps
- Helper functions for preference management

**Action Required**: Run the migration in Supabase SQL editor:
```sql
-- Copy contents of database-settings-migration.sql
-- Execute in Supabase SQL Editor
```

### 2. Custom Hooks

#### **useUserPreferences** (`src/hooks/useUserPreferences.ts`)
Manages global user account preferences:
- `useUserPreferences()` - Fetch preferences (creates defaults if missing)
- `useUpdateUserPreferences()` - Update preferences

#### **useStokvelSettings** (`src/hooks/useStokvelSettings.ts`)
Manages stokvel-specific settings:

- `useUpdateStokvelRuleSettings()` - Update contribution/payout rules
- `getStokvelNotificationSettings()` - Extract notification settings
- `getStokvelRuleSettings()` - Extract rule settings
