    question: 'Can I manage multiple stokvels?',
    keywords: ['multiple', 'several', 'many'],
    answer: 'Yes! You can create, join, and manage multiple stokvels from one account. Use the "My Stokvels" page to switch between them. Many people participate in multiple stokvels (e.g., vehicle stokvel, grocery stokvel, burial society).'

        <p>Follow these steps:</p>
        <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-1">
          <li>Click "Browse Stokvel Types" from My Stokvels page</li>
          <li>Choose a stokvel type that matches your goal</li>

    category: 'getting-started',
    question: 'How many members do I need to start?',
    keywords: ['minimum', 'members', 'size', 'how many'],
    answer: 'You can start with as few as 3 members, but most stokvels work best with 10-15 members. This balances manageable group size with adequate monthly pools and reasonable rotation duration.'
  },

    id: 'change-stokvel-type',
    category: 'getting-started',
    question: 'Can I change the stokvel type after creation?',
    keywords: ['change', 'type', 'modify', 'switch'],
    answer: 'Generally no, because stokvel types have different payout rules and logic. Changing types would disrupt the existing calculations and agreements. You\'d need to create a new stokvel with the correct type instead.'

    category: 'getting-started',
    question: 'What if a member wants to join mid-cycle?',

  },
  {
    id: 'verify-contribution',
    category: 'contributions',
    question: 'How do I verify contributions?',

    category: 'contributions',
    question: 'What if I miss a payment?',
    keywords: ['missed', 'late', 'overdue', 'skip'],
    answer: 'Communicate with your admin immediately. Most stokvels have a 3-7 day grace period. Persistent non-payment may affect your rotation turn or membership status. Options include: extension with or without late fee, partial payment arrangement, skip turn in rotation, or temporary inactive status.'

  {
    id: 'partial-payment',
    category: 'contributions',
    question: 'Can I make a partial payment?',
    keywords: ['partial', 'split', 'installment'],
    answer: 'Some stokvels allow partial payments, others require full amounts. Check with your admin. If allowed, record the actual amount paid, add a note about it being partial, and create a second contribution entry when the balance is paid.'

  {
    id: 'change-contribution-amount',
    category: 'contributions',
    question: 'Can the monthly contribution amount be changed?',
    keywords: ['change', 'increase', 'decrease', 'amount'],
    answer: 'Yes, but it requires group agreement/vote. Changes apply to future contributions only (not retroactive). Document the reason, update in Settings â†’ Financial Settings, and notify all members. Increases are more common than decreases.'

    category: 'payouts',
    question: 'How do I process a payout?',

    category: 'payouts',
    question: 'Do I contribute after receiving my payout?',
    keywords: ['after', 'continue', 'post-receipt'],
    answer: 'Usually yes! In vehicle stokvels, you contribute a higher amount after receiving (e.g., R8,000 vs R3,500) to help others. This is built into the stokvel model to ensure fairness and help remaining members reach their goals faster.'

    question: 'What if payout amount is less than expected?',
    keywords: ['less', 'lower', 'amount', 'calculation'],

    category: 'members',
    question: 'How does rotation order work?',
    keywords: ['rotation', 'order', 'queue', 'sequence'],
    answer: 'Members are assigned numbers (1, 2, 3, etc.). Member #1 receives first payout. After receiving, they\'re skipped in future cycles. The next eligible member (lowest number who hasn\'t received) is next. Inactive members are skipped automatically.'

    question: 'Can I remove a member?',
    keywords: ['remove', 'delete', 'kick out'],

      <div className="space-y-2">
        <p>Fairness calculation ensures all members pay the same total amount despite timing differences in rotation:</p>
        <p><strong>The Problem:</strong> Early receivers pay more total (longer time at higher rate), late receivers pay less (shorter time).</p>

          <li>Average Net Position = Average of all members</li>

    id: 'fairness-required',
    category: 'fairness',
    question: 'Do I have to participate in fairness adjustment?',
    keywords: ['required', 'mandatory', 'optional'],
    answer: 'If it was agreed upon in the stokvel rules, yes. Fairness is essential for ethical operation and ensures no one is disadvantaged by their position in rotation. Without fairness adjustment, early members subsidize late members significantly.'
